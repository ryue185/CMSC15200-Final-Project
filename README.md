# CMSC15200-Final-Project

- This is the final project from the Introduction to Computer Science-II course I took at the University of Chicago
- It is a simple game called Hangtime, written in C
- The game is represented in ascii art @('_')@
- Players take turns placing pieces on a board
- A player wins when they form an uninterrupted run of a specified number of pieces
- Pieces placed NOT on the bottom row of the board will drop down after a specified number of turns, creating unexpected situations during gameplay
- I've added this in here when I first started exploring GitHub,
- Consider this a test case using random code I found on my computer
